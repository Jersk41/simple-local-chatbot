# simple-local-chatbot

## Introduction

This is a simple chatbot built using Node.js and the `ollama` library. It allows users to interact with the chatbot through a text-based interface, and it can understand natural language input to generate responses. The chatbot uses a machine learning model to generate responses based on the input provided by the user.

The project includes a simple web server that listens for incoming HTTP requests and routes them to the appropriate endpoints. It also includes a `chat` endpoint that handles incoming chat messages from the user and generates a response using the machine learning model.

## Features
1. Automatic train ticket order with AI Assistant
2. Can run locally with `ollama`
3. Access train schedule in real-time (upcoming update)
